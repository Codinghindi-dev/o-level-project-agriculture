                <h2>Seeds</h2>
                <p>Seeds are the most essential and fundamental part of agriculture. They are the starting point of the
                    entire farming process. A seed contains the embryo of a future plant and has the potential to grow
                    into a mature, healthy crop under favorable conditions. The quality of seeds determines the overall
                    success of farming because good seeds ensure better germination, strong plant growth, and high
                    productivity.

                    In ancient times, farmers used traditional methods to save seeds from previous harvests for the next
                    season. However, with the development of agricultural science, improved and hybrid seeds were
                    introduced. These scientifically developed seeds are more resistant to pests, diseases, and harsh
                    weather conditions. They also produce higher yields and better-quality crops.
                    <br>A good quality seed must have the following characteristics:<br>

                    <h2>Animal Husbandray</h2>
                    <p>Animal Husbandry is the branch of agriculture that deals with the care, breeding, and management
                        of animals for human benefit. It includes raising animals such as cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep,
                        pigs, poultry, and fish to obtain products like milk, meat, eggs, wool, leather, and manure. It
                        plays a major role in improving farmers’ income and strengthening the rural economy.

                        1. Meaning and Importance:
                        Animal husbandry means the scientific management of farm animals for food and other resources.
                        It is not just about keeping animals; it involves proper feeding, sheltering, breeding, and
                        healthcare. In rural areas, animal husbandry is an important source of livelihood besides crop
                        farming. It provides daily income through milk, eggs, or meat sales and serves as a financial
                        backup during crop failure.

                    <h2>Crops</h2>
                    <p>Crops are plants that are cultivated on a large scale by farmers to obtain food, fiber, fodder,
                        and other useful products. Agriculture mainly depends on crop cultivation, as it provides food
                        for humans and feed for animals. Crops are grown according to the type of soil, climate, and
                        season of the region. India, being an agricultural country, produces a wide variety of crops
                        throughout the year.
                        <br>
                        1. Meaning of Crops:
                        Crops are plants grown in large quantities in fields for consumption or commercial purposes.
                        They include grains, fruits, vegetables, pulses, and fibers. Different crops require specific
                        climatic conditions, soil types, and irrigation facilities for proper growth and yield.
                        In India, crops are mainly classified into two categories based on the season — Kharif and Rabi
                        crops.

                        Kharif Crops:
                        These crops are sown with the beginning of the monsoon (June–July) and harvested at the end of
                        the rainy season (October–November). They require a warm and wet climate.
                        Examples: Rice, maize, cotton, jowar, bajra, sugarcane, and groundnut.

                    <h2>Fertilizer </h2>
                    <p>Fertilizers are chemical or natural substances added to the soil to provide essential nutrients
                        required for the healthy growth of plants. They play a vital role in modern agriculture by
                        increasing crop yield and improving soil fertility. Fertilizers supply important elements like
                        nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which plants need for their overall development. Without
                        fertilizers, it is difficult to achieve high productivity, especially when the same land is used
                        for cultivation repeatedly.
                        1. Meaning and Importance:
                        Fertilizers are materials that enrich the soil with nutrients that plants lose during farming.
                        When crops are harvested, they take away nutrients from the soil, making it less fertile over
                        time. By adding fertilizers, farmers can restore these nutrients and ensure better plant growth.
                        Fertilizers help plants grow faster, produce more grains or fruits, and stay healthy.

                        <h2>Horticulture</h2>
                        <p>Horticulture is the branch of agriculture that deals with the cultivation of fruits,
                            vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants. It focuses on improving the quality,
                            productivity, and aesthetic value of plants grown for food, decoration, or medicinal
                            purposes. The word horticulture comes from two Latin words — hortus meaning “garden” and
                            cultura meaning “cultivation.” Hence, horticulture literally means “garden cultivation.” It
                            is one of the most important sectors of agriculture that contributes to food security,
                            income generation, and environmental balance.

                            Horticulture plays a vital role in providing nutritious food and improving the economy of
                            farmers. Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, and fiber essential
                            for human health. Flower and ornamental plant cultivation provides beauty to our
                            surroundings and also supports industries like

                                Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crops at regular intervals to ensure
                                their proper growth and development. It is one of the most important agricultural
                                practices, especially in regions where rainfall is insufficient or irregular. Proper
                                irrigation helps maintain soil moisture, improves crop yield, and ensures food security.
                                Without irrigation, farming in dry or semi-arid areas would be nearly impossible.

                                1. Meaning and Importance of Irrigation:
                                Irrigation refers to the artificial application of water to agricultural fields through
                                various methods. Water is essential for plants to absorb nutrients from the soil,

                                    pests that damage crops, livestock, and stored food. Pests include insects, weeds,
                                    fungi, rodents, and microorganisms that harm agricultural production. The use of
                                    pesticides helps farmers protect their crops, increase productivity, and reduce
                                    post-harvest losses. However, their excessive or careless use can harm human health,

                                    (harmful organism) and “cide” (to kill). Pesticides are essential for protecting

                                        <p>Successful farming requires not just hard work but also smart techniques. The
                                            first and most important step is to maintain soil health. Farmers should
                                            test their soil regularly and add organic manure or compost to improve
                                            fertility. Balanced use of fertilizers helps keep the soil productive for a
                                            long time. Proper irrigation management is also essential; using drip or
                                            sprinkler systems saves water and ensures that crops receive adequate
                                            moisture. Watering plants early in the morning or late in the evening
                                            reduces evaporation and increases efficiency.

                                            Farmers should practice crop rotation, growing different types of crops in
                                            the same field each season. This method improves soil nutrients and reduces
                                            the chances of pest attacks.
